In this document we collect tasks which need doing in this project.
Let's put in brackets after the description the name of a person who
grabs the task and starts working on it.

 - Design graph traversal use cases. (Markus)
 - Implement graph producing job. (Max)

 - Implement a job which creates a search view on a collection.
 - Implement a random graph use case.
 - Implement smart graph versions of the above.
 - Implement a disjoint smart graph use case.
 - Switch payloads to different sizes.
 - ...



Done:

 - Honour the field `NumberFields` in data generation by distributing
   the current `Payload` field across multiple fields. Fixed total maximum
   of say 16 is OK for now. (Max)
 - Implement framework for graph producers. (Max)
 - Improve argument processing. (Max)
 - Implement graph producers. (Roman)
 - Implement random reads on a collection (with latency and throughput
 - Implement a replace job for `normal`. (Julia)
 - Implement an update job for `normal`. (Julia)
 - Design the interface to graph generators. (Max)
   measurements). (Julia)
 - Implement random reads from an index (with latency and throughput
   measurements). Julia
 - Implement bulk reads from an index (with latency and throughput
   measurements). Julia
 - Implement a job which creates a bunch of indexes on the additional fields. (Julia)
 - Design read load use cases.
 - Implement a binary tree graph generator.
 - Allow to distribute load across multiple coordinators (we already have
   multiple endpoints). (Max) Done, but needs further testing.
 - Implement bulk reads on a collection (with latency and throughput
   measurements). This is essentially an AQL read from the primary index.
   (Julia)
 - Drop collection job. (Max)
 - Metrics. (Max)
 - Truncate collection job. (Max)
 - Drop index job. (Max)
 - Drop database job. (Max)
